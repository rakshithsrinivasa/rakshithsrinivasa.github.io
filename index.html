            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a senior machine learning researcher at Samsung Research America, Mountain View, CA.</p>
            <p>My research interests include multimodal LLMs, cross-modal representation alignment and efficient inference. I am also interested in efficient algorithms for linear algebraic computations and in using tools from randomized linear algebra to solve optimization problems. </p>
            <p>I obtained my Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta in 2020. My advisor was <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/justin-romberg" target="_blank">Dr. Justin Romberg</a>. I also worked closely with <a href="https://mdav.ece.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Mark Davenport</a>. During my Ph.D., I worked on subspace learning and sketching methods for high-dimensional linear algebra for applications in array signal processing. Following my Ph.D., I was a research scientist at <a href="https://iqvia.com" target="_blank">IQVIA</a>, where I worked on graph neural networks and deep learning based ranking methods for applications in clinical trial patient recruitment and prediction of COVID-19 spread. I joined Samsung Research America as a senior ML researcher in 2021, where I have been working on multimodal learning, on-device AI, and LLM based language translation.</p>
           <p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis (and most other racket sports), hiking, playing scrabble and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/intermittent_eating/" target="_blank">cooking</a>. I enjoy running and I have completed the San Francisco Marathon in 2023 and I am currently working on improving my timing. I am also a dance enthusiast and enjoy latin dacing, including salsa and bachata.</p>
